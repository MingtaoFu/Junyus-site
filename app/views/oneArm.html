                <p>
                    OneArm is the first project in which I was involved as one of the founding members of a startup. We
                    attempt to build a gesture control armband that allows people control computers and other devices in a
                    simpler way. OneArm recognizes users' gestures by measuring electrical activities (sEMG: Surface Electromyography)
                    from muscles on their arms. We use Bluetooth to connect OneArm and compatible devices.
                    With the software client, users are able to take control of applications on computer or other devices
                    with five basic gestures and their specific combinations.

                <h3>Problem Space</h3>
                <p>
                    ln order to better understand the challenges involved and pinpoint the most crucial user demands, we
                    spent one week on using and anatomizing near 10 popular related products, including Sing! by Smule,
                    Rhythm Master by Tencent, SoundHound, ScoreCloud, Changba, etc. We also interviewed with a
                    group of users who are obsessed with these products. From the analysis on products and the feed-
                    backs from users, we had the insights below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="black">Most of the users started using the products with the initial purpose of enhancing singing skill or
                        musical training.</span> When asked about why they kept playing with such products, people's answers
                        were basically varied> including playing or singing just for fun, getting to meet other users
                        through the platforms, following those senior singers and so on. Yet, another idea is common
                        among them: hoping to improve their singing skills.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="black">The products gÂ¡ve little systematic feedbacks that are helpful to improve user's singing
                            skill.</span> They are either highly community based Karaoke such as Sing! or exclusively
                        entertaining games like Rhythm Master. Although they may provide scores after finishing a
                        song according to users' performance, users cannot hone their skills of singing through such
                        simple feedbacks.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                        <span class="black">People want experiences that Bre both entertaining and educational.</span> They need products that
                        are entertaining and meanwhile are capable of providing them with professional and systematic
                        feedbacks through which they could improve singing performance correspondingly.

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    In the light of insights above, we brainstormed several feasible ideas for our product. To ensure our
                    methods could be justified in professional way, we have consulted students majoring in Vocal Music
                    from Central Conservatory of Music. Eventually, we came up with the solution below:
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Pitch Detection
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="black">We provide users with songs in different levels according to the complexity
                            of pitches.</span> Songs that have relatively narrow ranges of pitches are defined as easy
                        levels, while those having broader ranges of pitches are harder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="black">Users need to go through the game levels from easy to hard.</span> In each level, they are required to
                        sing with correct pitches to catch up the standard pitches. To pass each level, they need to reach
                        more than a specific amount of standard pitches.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Sense of Rhythm</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="black">The moment users sing in each pitch should match the rhythm.</span> Singing earlier or later than the
                        standard pitch will lower the scores.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="black">The difficulty of each level also involves the complexity of rhythms.</span> To pass each level, users
                        need to match more than a specific amount of standard rhythms.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    According to the standard above, after users play each Song we will show the scores as a whole to
                    them. Besides, feedbacks that contain which parts users need to improve are also available, and they
                    can choose to go back to practice those parts again and again untill they sing good enough to reach
                    the requirements.

                    Users are accessible to three different songs in each level. Songs in next levels are not available until
                    they pass the songs in the current one. They can also view their performance with the percentage of
                    pitches match and rhythm match. With the feedbacks, users can choose to practice the weak points in
                    each song.

                    Our Vision
                </h3>
                <p>
                    To us, Hummer is more than a game application. Through this project, we found that with the rapidly
                    advancing technologies people desire simpler tools that can not only bring them intriguing
                    entertainments, but also provide them with educational experiences. We attempt to create video games in which
                    people could master specific skills in an intuitive and simple way.
