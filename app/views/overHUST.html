                        OverHUST was derived in 2013 "UT-STARCOM Seed Cup" Mobile App Developing Competition. With
                        the topic "A Better Life on Campus" of the competition, we attempted to build an app
                        that allows users to navigate in street view map on campus. The project aims to help the
                        freshmen or other students and staff who are not familiar with the campus to find their
                        destinations. After two-month development, our team got in the finals and won the First
                        Prize out of more than 50 teams.

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST) is among the largest universities in China. The
                        area of HUST is about 5,333 square kilometers. When I first came to my university, I found that the
                        campus was so large that it took me a long time to get familiar with the campus. In fact, after I spent
                        one year on living in Apartment 16, Yunyuan, I even could not easily find the Apartment 15, Yunyuan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To justify the problem stated above, we asked a group of students who lived on campus for less than
                        one year about how they get to the buildings they have never been to. Many of them claimed that they
                        were usually confused about the structure of the buildings on campus and it often took a significant
                        amount of time for them to find out the buildings. When they got lost, they would use map apps to
                        navigate. However, the apps like Google Maps, Baidu Maps did not provide much detailed information
                        about buildings on campus since they mainly focus on the streets in cities. These products could not
                        always satisfy students' need.

                    <p>
                        We took advantage of street view map SDK from Tencent Maps and develop an app featured with four
                        major functions based on campus.

                    <p>
                        We pulled the data from the SDK and recalculate the geographic coordinates of each position
                        throughout the campus. When users enter the function MAP, the app will pinpoint their current
                        locations and load the corresponding street view. The function allows users to walk over the campus
                        without going out in person.

                    <p>
                        Since the original map data from SDK does not include navigation service, we designed an algorithm
                        that enables the navigation between any two buildings on campus. The app will guide people to the
                        buildings based on street view map. People no longer need to look at those confusing traditional map
                        from vertical view, greatly improving the eciency of finding out their destinations.

                        For many freshmen, they want to explore the new places that they are interested in. For example,
                        HUST has 34 different canteens on campus, so many students may want to try various delicious foods
                        from dierent cafeterias. We put all the buildings into the database. Users could explore the places
                        throughout the campus by typing in key words, such as cafeteria, teaching building, or supermarket.
                        For each search result, user could choose either Go There (trigger navigation) or Street View (load the
                        street view of the building).

                        We attempted to provide students with real-time information about school buses so that they could
                        save their time on waiting for school buses. To implement this, we need to install GPS modules in the
                        buses. We are persuading bus drivers to help us do this when the app has served many enough users.

                        This was the first project that I tried to transform my idea to problems I observed into real product.
                        In the design phase, I analyzed the features of existing products, studied excellent design works, and
                        conducted user survey among a group of students, which brought me to pinpoint the real demands of
                        users. As we had received lots of positive feedbacks and praises for the product, I enjoyed a great
                        sense of accomplishments that what I designed had improved peopleâ€™s lives throughout the campus.
